Apologies for the rapid resubmission. This is mainly to avoid archival given the upcoming archiving of a dependency (alphashape3D), which we have moved to Suggests and now use conditionally.

Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:

These are false positives, as both URLs are valid and resolve correctly on all broswers tested (Safari 14.0, Chrome 86.0.4240.111, Firefox 82.0).
